# Contribution Guide

If you find some bugs or have a nice idea for enhancements, submitting issues or pull requests is welcome.

- Make sure that your code passes linting and formatting, and can be built successfully.
- Submitting issues before opening PRs is not required, but I recommend doing so.
- The discussion feature is also enabled. Feel free to post questions or discussions.
- This repo is managed by the artist himself. For some types of modifications, I'll ask the producers and designer to decide.
